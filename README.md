# FaceCursor

Hi, thanks for stopping by! 
This is a desktop application I built during the summer which allows users to control their mouse cursor using facial movements alone.
The application fetches feed from the user’s webcam and is controlled with the following commands:

      •     Moving your head left and right -> moves the cursor left and right
      •	Moving your head up and down -> moves the cursor up and down
      •	Winking with your right eye -> right click on a mouse
      •	Winking with your left eye -> left click on a mouse
      •	Opening your mouth -> Click ‘confirm’, ‘ok‘, ‘close’ etc.

Have a look!
